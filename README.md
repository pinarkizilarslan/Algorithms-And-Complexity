# Algorithms And Complexity

### Bubble Sort

### Selection Sort

### Insertion Sort

### Merge Sort

### Quick Sort
Using a pivot point element, the array is split into two parts where everything below the pivot point is smaller and everything above the pivot is larger. The pivot point then moves between the values on the left, putting them sequentially and then the values on the right. This is a "divide and conquer" algorithm because it involves making the larger list into smaller lists that are easier to sort.
Time complexity: Average case is O(nlogn).

### Heap Sort

### Radix Sort

### Counting Sort
